Create a FORK of this repository to store your code, data, and documentation for the final project. Detailed instructions for this assignment are in the course Moodle site.  The reason I'm asking you to fork this empty repository instead of creating a stand-alone repository is that it will be much easier for me and all students in the course to find all of our projects for code review and for grading. You can even get code review from students in the other section of IS590PR this way.

Even though your fork of this repository shall be public, you'll still need to explicitly add any students on your team as Collaborators in the Settings. That way you can grant them write privileges.

# Introduction
Everyone is familiar with the game Noughts and Crosses. We have created a level one Artificial Intelligence Algorithm using Monte Carlo tree search algorithm method to determine the best possible moves which could lead to a possible victory. The main focus of our project is performing Heuristic Search using Monte Carlos tree search methodology. We’ll be giving a new variation to this game, where the grid will be of 4*4 or 5*5, depending upon the player’s choice. However, the number of players will be 3 and the first player to get 3 in a row will win the game.
The symbols which we used for this game are:
X
O
T

# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:
(be sure to read the instructions given in course Moodle)

## Simulation's variables of uncertainty
List and describe your simulation's variables of uncertainty (where you're using pseudo-random number generation). For each such variable, how did you decide the range and probability distribution to use?  Do you think it's a good representation of reality?

## Hypothesis or hypotheses before running the simulation:

## Analytical Summary of your findings: (e.g. Did you adjust the scenario based on previous simulation outcomes?  What are the management decisions one could make from your simulation's output, etc.)

## Instructions on how to use the program:

# Strategies to consider for players during this game:
